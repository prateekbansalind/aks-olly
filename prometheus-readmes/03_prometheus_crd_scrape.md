# Customizing Prometheus Metrics Collection Using CRDs

This README provides an overview of how to use **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** to configure **Prometheus metrics scraping** in **Azure Monitor**. It explains how to customize metrics collection for pods and services using Kubernetes-native configurations.

For more detailed information, please refer to the official documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-crd).

## What are CRDs?

**Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** allow you to extend Kubernetes by creating custom resources that can be used to control and manage various applications. In the context of Prometheus, CRDs are used to configure **metrics scraping** for specific resources like pods and services.

---

## Pod and Service Monitors

- **PodMonitor**: Used to scrape metrics from individual pods. It defines the endpoints and intervals for scraping metrics.
- **ServiceMonitor**: Used to scrape metrics from services in your Kubernetes cluster. Similar to PodMonitor, it allows customization of scraping targets.

Both types of monitors allow you to:
- **Specify endpoints** for scraping.
- **Adjust scrape intervals** based on your needs.
- **Add labels** to categorize metrics.

## Using CRDs in Azure Monitor

**Azure Monitor** supports the use of **PodMonitor** and **ServiceMonitor** CRDs to manage Prometheus metrics scraping. By defining these resources in your cluster, you can:
- **Customize which metrics are collected**.
- **Control the scraping frequency**.
- **Target specific endpoints** for data collection.

---

## Key Customization Options

- **Scrape Intervals**: Define how often metrics should be scraped.
- **Endpoints**: Specify the URLs or services to scrape metrics from.
- **Labels**: Add labels to organize and filter metrics more easily.

---

## Applying CRDs

Once youâ€™ve defined your **PodMonitor** or **ServiceMonitor**, apply them to your cluster using `kubectl`. Prometheus will automatically start collecting metrics based on the defined configuration.

---

## Best Practices

- **Limit the scope**: Use CRDs to focus on the pods and services that matter, avoiding unnecessary data collection.
- **Optimize intervals**: Set scrape intervals that balance real-time insights with storage and cost efficiency.

---

## Summary

Using **CRDs** such as **PodMonitor** and **ServiceMonitor** gives you fine-grained control over which metrics are collected from your Kubernetes clusters. This allows you to customize Prometheus scraping based on your needs, ensuring efficient and effective monitoring.
