# Prometheus Scrape Configuration Using ConfigMap

This README provides an overview of how to create, validate, and troubleshoot a **Prometheus scrape configuration file** in **Azure Monitor**. The configuration file is used as a **ConfigMap** in Kubernetes to customize which metrics Prometheus should scrape and how it interacts with various services.

For more detailed information, please refer to the official documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-validate).

## What is a Prometheus Scrape Configuration File?

A **Prometheus scrape configuration file** defines how Prometheus collects metrics from different services or endpoints. The configuration file is used as a **ConfigMap** in Kubernetes, allowing you to manage custom metrics scraping in your cluster.

The file includes information like:
- **Endpoints** to scrape.
- **Scraping intervals** (how often to scrape).
- **Authentication methods** for secure scraping (e.g., Basic Auth, TLS).

---

## Creating a Custom Scrape Configuration File

You can create a custom **scrape configuration file** to instruct Prometheus on which metrics to collect, from where, and how frequently. This file is then applied as a **ConfigMap** in your Kubernetes cluster.

### Key Configuration Components:
- **scrape_interval**: Defines how often Prometheus should scrape metrics from the specified endpoints.
- **scrape_timeout**: Specifies the maximum time Prometheus will wait for a response.
- **target_labels**: Allows you to add labels to organize metrics.
- **auth_config**: Includes authentication details like Basic Auth or TLS for secure scraping.

---

## Authentication Options

- **Basic Authentication**: You can include a username and password for services that require authentication.
- **TLS Authentication**: For enhanced security, you can configure TLS certificates to ensure a secure connection between Prometheus and the service.

### Example:
If a service requires a secure connection, you would include the TLS certificates in the configuration file as part of the **ConfigMap**.

## Validation of the Scrape Configuration

After creating the configuration file and applying it as a **ConfigMap**, it is important to validate that the setup is working correctly.

### Validation Steps:
- Check logs using `kubectl logs` to see if metrics are being collected successfully.
- Ensure that the target endpoints are reachable and responsive.
- Verify the authentication methods are set up properly (Basic Auth or TLS).

---

## Troubleshooting Scrape Configurations

If metrics are not being collected correctly, you can troubleshoot the setup by:
- Reviewing logs for errors.
- Testing endpoint connectivity.
- Confirming that the authentication configuration (e.g., credentials) is correct.

---

## Best Practices

- **Set Appropriate Intervals**: Only scrape metrics as frequently as needed to reduce data volume and storage costs.
- **Use Secure Scraping**: Always secure your connections using TLS when collecting sensitive data.
- **Regularly Validate**: Keep an eye on the scrape configuration and ensure it is always working as expected.

---

## Summary

The **Prometheus scrape configuration file** used as a **ConfigMap** allows you to customize metrics collection for your Kubernetes cluster. You can specify scraping intervals, configure authentication, and ensure that metrics are securely and effectively collected. Regular validation and troubleshooting help ensure that your configuration is working correctly.
