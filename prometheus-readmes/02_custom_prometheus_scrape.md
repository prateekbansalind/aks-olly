# Customizing Prometheus Metrics Scraping for AKS

This README provides an overview of how to **customize Prometheus metrics scraping** for your Kubernetes clusters using **Azure Monitor**. It explains different methods for configuring what metrics are collected, how often they are scraped, and which endpoints are targeted.

For more details, visit the official documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-configuration).

## Custom Scraping Overview

By default, Prometheus collects metrics from Kubernetes components and stores them in **Azure Monitor**. Customizing scraping allows you to control:
- **Which metrics are collected**.
- **How often they are scraped**.
- **Which endpoints are targeted**.

This helps you fine-tune metrics collection based on your needs.

## Methods for Customizing Scraping

### 1. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
- **CRDs** allow you to define scraping behavior directly within your Kubernetes cluster. You can specify:
  - Which metrics to scrape.
  - How often to scrape them (scrape interval).
  - Which labels to add to the data.
  
- **Example**: Create a CRD to scrape metrics from a custom application in your cluster.

### 2. Scrape Configuration File (Advanced Setup)
- Alternatively, you can use a **scrape configuration file** to define what Prometheus should scrape.
- This file supports:
  - **Basic Authentication** (username/password) for secure scraping.
  - **TLS Authentication** for enhanced security.
  
- **Example**: Scrape metrics from an external service that requires authentication.

---

## Scrape Intervals

- **Scrape interval**: The time between two consecutive scrapes (e.g., every 30 seconds).
- Shorter intervals provide more real-time data but increase storage costs.
- Longer intervals reduce data collection but may result in less frequent updates.

Adjust the interval based on the importance of the metrics you're monitoring.

---

## Relabeling

- **Relabeling**: A way to modify or add labels to scraped metrics. Labels make it easier to filter and group metrics for analysis.
  
- **Example**: Add a label to distinguish metrics collected from different applications or environments (e.g., production vs. development).

---

## Authentication for Scraping

- **Basic Authentication**: Use if the endpoint requires a username and password.
- **TLS Authentication**: Provides secure communication between Prometheus and the endpoint by verifying identities and securing data.

---

## Best Practices

- **Minimize Data**: Only scrape the metrics you need to reduce storage costs.
- **Use Proper Intervals**: Set intervals that balance data freshness and cost.
- **Secure Scraping**: Use secure methods like **TLS Authentication** for external services.

## Summary

You can customize **Prometheus metrics scraping** for AKS clusters using either **CRDs** or a **scrape configuration file**. Adjust intervals, target specific endpoints, and secure the process using authentication methods like **Basic Auth** or **TLS Auth**.
